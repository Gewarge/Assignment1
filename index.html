<p>●  What do the results of these tests mean for you? 
The results of these tests help me to understand my personality traits and learning style.</p>
<p>●  How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? 
In a team I will be able to adapt to learning with my varied learning styles. My high ‘feeling’ rating will allow me to work well with a team and hear multiple points of view and ideas and my intuitive nature will allow me to act in challenging situations in order to complete tasks confidently.</p>
<p>●  How should you take this into account when forming a team? 
I should use the analysis of my results to discover my own weaknesses and then seek out other people more proficient to fill in the gaps in order to make the most effective team possible.</p>


  <h1> Project Ideas </h1>
  
<p>1.	Overview (100 words) This should be a summary of what the project will be. 

<p>A VR application that aims to provide a first person perspective of the interior and exterior of a house in order to allow potential buyers to view the house in all its usual detail via a headset based in their current home. This technology will make the act of purchasing a new property much easier by allowing the buyers to immediately defer any questions they may have had about the property. The application will require full 3d scans to be made of all or some rooms in the house this will allow users to then explore that space from their own home as if they were there. </p>  

<p>2.	Motivation (100) words) This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as ``There are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem.'' </p>

<p>The application will be useful for both real-estate companies and customers. Customers will be able to identify whether rooms are the correct size whether the houses layout will suit there needs and other details about both the interior and exterior. The app will make the buyers life easier by allowing them to view multiple houses in one day and be able to narrow down there preferred property quickly and efficiently. The real-estate companies will benefit from the app by being able to provide superior advertising and more detailed and insightful information about the properties.</p>

<p>3.	Description (500 words) Detailed description of the features of the product or service. Tools and Technologies (100) words) Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate. </p>

<p>The app should be able to run on all a wide range of VR products including lower end models such as the Google Daydream or the Samsung Gear VR, with this capability the app will be widely accessible only requiring a modern smartphone to operate. The capabilities of the app will depend slightly on the technology it is running on, on higher end VR headsets such as Oculus and HTC products the user will have access to new features incorporating the hand held controllers. I envision the ability for customers to view a room and manage its look to suit their liking in the virtual world, they will have access to wallpaper, curtains, furniture management and other smaller details that would allow them to construct their own custom vision for the house before they purchase it. In order for the customer to have the ability to add and move furniture in the virtual world a generic empty room may need to be displayed to the user but the dimensions will be identical to real room taking into account irregular room shapes and integrated features such as a fireplace or marble tabletop. The app would include a feature that allowed the users to access databases with information on furniture stock from popular retailers, the users will have the option to insert real life furniture from their favourite stores as a scale model in order to create a more detailed picture of what their ideal home would look like. This feature will incorporate great amount of detail into the experience allowing the user to change the colour and material of objects with the goal of creating the most immersive experience possible. Ultimately the app aims to be replace the need to visit a house in person and create an equally immersive and insightful experience that becomes more productive and helpful with the addition of interactivity with the virtual world. The app could be developed using the Unity engine and 3D camera scan technology. In conclusion the app will have a low barrier of entry only requiring a lower end VR headset, it will provide an array of uses ranging from learning more in depth details about a property to personalising a potential home by interacting with a virtual space. The function of the app is comparatively simple and could use many other existing apps as inspiration, despite its apparent simplicity the app will introduce a new level of marketing for businesses and a new level of ease of use for customers in the niche real estate industry.</p>

<p>4.	Skills Required (100 words) List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required? </p>

<p>I would need to become much more familiar with programming languages and various app building software’s. I would need skills specifically in developing VR products in order to achieve the fundamental aspect of the product. I would require a device to test prototypes in VR and knowledge and experience of what is expected for a satisfactory user experience in a VR application, for this I will need to research the history and development of VR and gain experience using VR equipment first hand in order to understand what a VR app requires. </p>

<p>5.	Outcome (100 words) If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have? </p>

<p>If the application is developed and includes the features listed then hopefully it will become a common addition to many real estate companies existing systems, hopefully it acts as an improvement over the existing systems and is incorporated in order to bridge the gap between the customers and the property allowing them to gain a greater understanding of the properties they view inevitably making their search a  and choice a little more simple. The app should introduce a new level of planning for the customer allowing them to visualise every aspect of their new home before they make a purchase.</p>
